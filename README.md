My first README
In this repository (alx-pre_course), I created:
0x01-git directory
Sub-directories: bash, c, js
bash files: bash/alx, bash/school
c file: c_is_fun.c
js files: js/main, js/index
Created a branch named update_script
Made changes, updated, add, commit and push
Merge conflicts
Create a .gitignore file
